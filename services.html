<p>Social media can have both positive and negative influences on teenagers' self-esteem and body image. Articles and surveys revealed that most teens compare themselves to filtered or edited content online—even when they know it’s not real. This can lead to feelings of insecurity or low confidence. However, some social media content promotes body positivity and support, which helps teens feel seen and accepted. Social media doesn’t always harm—it depends on how it's used.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">How does social media influence teenagers' self-esteem and perception of  body image?</h1>
<p> Social media can negatively impact teenagers' self-esteem and body image by exposing them to unrealistic beauty standards and fostering constant comparisons. The curated, often digitally altered, images prevalent on platforms like Instagram and TikTok can create an unrealistic ideal that teens strive for, leading to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with their own appearance. </p>
<h4>Here's a more detailed breakdown:</h4>

    <h2>1. Unrealistic Beauty  
    Standards:</h2>
    <p>Social media platforms are filled with images of seemingly perfect individuals, often showcasing an unattainable body type and lifestyle.

These images, often heavily edited or filtered, contribute to the perception of a beauty ideal that is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in reality.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">This constant exposure to unrealistic standards can deeply affect how teenagers perceive themselves. Many begin to question their own appearance, comparing themselves to influencers and peers who seem to have flawless skin, perfect bodies, and exciting lives. Over time, this can lead to a distorted self-image, where teens feel inadequate or unattractive simply because they don’t match what they see online. Even when they know these posts are edited or curated, the emotional impact remains strong. For some, this pressure fuels a cycle of editing their own photos or striving to change their appearance, not for self-satisfaction, but to meet the expectations of an online audience. In the long run, these habits can lower self-esteem and contribute to mental health struggles like anxiety, depression, or body dysmorphia.</span></p>

    <h2>2. Impact on Self-Esteem: </h2>
